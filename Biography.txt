Hi there! 

My name is Vicktor Jaimes, at the moment writing this biography note I'm 21 years old, I'm living in BogotÃ¡-Colombia,
I enjoy reading manga, listening music, playing videogames and contemplate the impermanence...
I'm working for a bilingual Call Center and I have a deep desire to learn new things and do interesting things with my life.

During Isolation, it came to me as a revelation... By programming, pretty interesting stuff can be done....
So I have started to study Computer Science this year and I'm very excited for what is about to come.

So, yes, that's me, so far. >:D
